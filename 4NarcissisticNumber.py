A number is said to be a narcissistic number, 
if the addition value of each digit raised to 
the power of numbers of digits available in the original number is equal to the original number.

Instance-1

Input number is 153.

Letâ€™s check it by using the logic of Narcissistic number.

Number of digits available in 153 is 3.

Calculate the power values and add those = (1^3) + (5^3) + (3^3) = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

As we notice here both the calculated number and original number are same.

Hence, 153 is a narcissistic number.
